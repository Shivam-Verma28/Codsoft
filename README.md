# CodSoft Virtual Internship - Python Programming

Greetings! I'm Shivam Verma, and I'm thrilled to present my progress in the CodSoft Virtual Internship repository on GitHub. This repository encapsulates my journey through completing tasks for the virtual internship in Python programming.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Task no. 1 - To-Do List

In this task, I crafted a To-Do List application to streamline task management. Users can effortlessly add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove completed tasks. The intuitive interface enhances the overall experience of organizing tasks efficiently.

*Branch:* [Task-no.-1--To-Do-List](https://github.com/Shivam-Verma28/Codsoft/tree/Task-no.-1--To-Do-List)

### 2. Task no. 2 - Calculator

The Calculator program, born out of the second task, is a versatile tool for basic arithmetic operations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. With a user-friendly interface, users can input values and obtain precise results with ease.

*Branch:* [Task-no.-2--Calculator](https://github.com/Shivam-Verma28/Codsoft/tree/Task-no.-2--Calculator)

### 3. Task no. 3 - Password Generator

Task number three led to the creation of a robust Random Password Generator. This utility empowers users to generate secure and personalized passwords by customizing the length and character inclusion/exclusion options.
